# Network Manager

This document describes the network manager interfaces in the AOS Core Library common.

## Overview

The network manager provides interfaces for network resource management between CM (Cloud Manager) and
SM (Service Manager). It defines the communication contract for allocating/releasing network resources
and handling deferred firewall rule updates.

These interfaces are placed in `common` because they are used by both CM and SM:

- **CM side**: CM NetworkManager implements `NetworkProviderItf` to serve network allocation requests.
  CM SMController implements `PendingUpdateHandlerItf` to push resolved firewall updates to SM via gRPC stream.
- **SM side**: SM Client uses `NetworkProviderItf` to call CM for network allocation.
  SM NetworkManager implements `PendingUpdateHandlerItf` to receive and apply resolved firewall rules.

## Interface Descriptions

### NetworkProviderItf

Network provider interface used by SM to communicate with CM for network resource management.

**Methods:**

- `GetNodeNetworkParams(networkID, nodeID, result)`: Gets node network parameters (subnet, IP, VLAN) from CM.
- `AllocateInstanceNetwork(instance, networkID, nodeID, serviceData, result)`: Allocates network resources for an
  instance on CM. Returns allocated IP, DNS servers, and firewall rules. If dependent instances are not yet available,
  partial firewall rules are returned (deferred firewall).
- `ReleaseInstanceNetwork(instance, nodeID)`: Releases instance network resources on CM.
- `ReleaseNodeNetwork(networkID, nodeID)`: Releases node-level network resources on CM.

### PendingUpdateHandlerItf

Handler interface for deferred firewall update notifications. Used on both CM and SM sides:

- **CM side**: SMController implements this to push resolved pending firewall rules to SM via gRPC stream.
- **SM side**: SM NetworkManager implements this to receive and apply resolved firewall rules.

**Methods:**

- `OnPendingFirewallUpdate(nodeID, update)`: Called when the firewall rules of an instance change.
  The update contains the instance identifier and the instance's whole current rule set, which replaces the rules
  held by the receiver.

## Deferred Firewall Rules

When an instance has `allowedConnections` to another instance that is not yet allocated, CM returns partial firewall
rules (without the missing dependency). CM tracks these as pending connections. When the dependency instance is later
allocated, re-allocated or released, CM re-resolves the rules of every instance that references it and pushes each
instance's whole rule set via `PendingUpdateHandlerItf::OnPendingFirewallUpdate`.
SM then applies only the firewall CNI plugin without restarting other network plugins.
